You can try running bluetoothctl from the command line, make sure your device is on / ready to be discovered:

$ bluetoothctl
[NEW] Controller AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF device-name [default]
Any other bluetooth devices will be listed here. You'll then be inside a [bluetooth] prompt.

First, turn bluetooth power on (if your device is off):

[bluetooth]# power on
Changing power on succeeded
Then, make sure your agent is registered:

[bluetooth]# agent on
Agent registered

[bluetooth]# default-agent

Now you can scan for devices from the console:

[bluetooth]# scan on
Discovery started
[CHG] Controller AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF Discovering: yes
[NEW] Device FF:EE:DD:CC:BB:AA Someone's Keyboard
You can manually pair from here as well:

[bluetooth]# pair FF:EE:DD:CC:BB:AA 
Attempting to pair with FF:EE:DD:CC:BB:AA 
[CHG] Device C8:E0:EB:04:52:55 Connected: yes
At this point, you should be prompted to enter a pin code for pairing:

Request PIN code
[agent] Enter PIN code: 12345
Enter a number (eg. 12345), and you will be prompted to input the same number from the device:

[Someone's Keyboard]# 12345
