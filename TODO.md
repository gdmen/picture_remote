- threaded / subprocess uploads so that taking multiple pictures isn't so delayed
- real logging with logrotation (write logs to dropbox in realtime?)
- easier shutdown of pi
- some indicator of when the system's warmed up? i.e. when pi is running + connected to network + python process is listening for keystrokes
- add error handling for config parsing
- scripted install / update process (w/ input IP+pass config)
